**MorphoLogic** is an interactive and fun way to explore fundamental **morphological operations** in image processing. Play with:  

✅ **Erosion** – Shrink objects in an image  
✅ **Dilation** – Expand objects for better visibility  
✅ **Opening** – Remove small noise while preserving shape  
✅ **Closing** – Fill small gaps for cleaner images  

🎨 **Generate** a binary image from any letter or number and apply these operations **in real time!**
